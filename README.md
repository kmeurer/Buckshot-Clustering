# Buckshot Clustering
An example of Buckshot Clustering using the adults dataset.  This project performs the following steps:

1.  perform Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) on a randomly sampled subset
of data (square root of n; n be the entire dataset)

2.  use k of the clusters generated in step 1 and assign the remaining of the n samples to
these k clusters based on their distance/similarity.
